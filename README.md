# Company Background  

**AltiQ Hardware** is a rapidly growing company with a global presence. The company specializes in selling computers and computer accessories through three main channels:  

- **Retailers**  
- **Direct Sales**  
- **Distributors**  

Recently, the company experienced an unexpected loss after opening a store in America. This decision was based on surveys, intuition, and limited Excel-based analysis. Meanwhile, competitors have well-established analytics teams enabling them to make data-driven decisions. To stay competitive and ensure better survival in the industry, AltiQ Hardware has decided to build its own analytics team to generate actionable insights and make informed decisions.

### Next Steps  

Following the project kick-off session, the **Data Engineering Team** provided the required datasets as requested by the **Data Analytics Team**. Let's dive into exploring and analyzing the data to build meaningful insights.  

# Dataset Overview  

Understanding the available data is crucial before starting any analysis. A clear understanding of the dataset structure ensures efficient and meaningful insights.

## Dataset Components  

### **Dimension Tables**  
These tables contain static data such as customer and product details.  

- **`dim_customer`**  
  - 27 distinct markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain)  
  - 75 distinct customers across all markets  
  - 2 platform types:  
    - **Brick & Mortar**: Physical/offline stores  
    - **E-commerce**: Online stores (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart)  
  - 3 sales channels:

# Importing Data into Power BI  

In this project, the database used is **MySQL**. To import datasets from the MySQL database into Power BI, follow these steps:  

1. **Establish Connection**  
   - Open Power BI Desktop.  
   - Navigate to the **Home** tab and click on **Get Data**.  
   - Select **MySQL Database** from the list of available connectors.  

2. **Provide Database Credentials**  
   - Enter the server name and database name.  
   - Provide the database access credentials (username and password).  

3. **Select Tables**  
   - Once connected, browse the database and select the required tables or views for your analysis.  

4. **Load or Transform Data**  
   - Choose either to load the data directly or transform it in Power Query for cleaning and shaping before analysis.  

This ensures seamless data integration from MySQL to Power BI, allowing for efficient analysis and visualization.  

# Data Model  

Data modeling is a crucial step in building effective Power BI reports. It serves as the foundation upon which all visuals and analyses are built. A well-structured data model improves the overall performance of the report, while poor data modeling can significantly impact performance and user experience.  

### Importance of Data Modeling  
- **Foundation for Reports**: All visuals and insights in the report are based on the data model.  
- **Performance Impact**: A poorly structured model can slow down the report's performance and lead to inefficiencies in analysis.  

### Best Practices in Data Modeling  
Following best practices for data modeling is essential to ensure an efficient and effective model. For more information on the best practices, refer to this [blog on data modeling best practices](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices).  

### Data Modeling Method Used  
In this project, we have used the **Snowflake Schema** (Snowfall data modeling method) to structure the data model. This method helps in organizing the data in a way that ensures both efficiency and scalability.
